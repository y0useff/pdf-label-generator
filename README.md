A custom desktop application developed with **Electron and Python** as a freelance project for a manufacturing client. The solution automates PDF label generation based on specific production criteria, replacing their manual label creation process and significantly improving operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Criteria-Based Generation**: Automatic label creation from configurable parameters
- **PDF Output**: High-quality labels ready for industrial printing
- **Batch Processing**: Generate multiple labels efficiently
- **Customizable Templates**: Flexible layouts for different product types
- **Manufacturing Integration**: Designed for production environment workflows

## Freelance Project Details

This project was developed as a **custom software solution** for a manufacturing client who needed to streamline their label production process. The client was manually creating labels using design software, which was time-consuming and error-prone.

### Client Requirements
- Replace manual label design workflow
- Generate consistent labels based on production data
- Support multiple product types and label formats
- Integrate with existing production scheduling
- Reduce labeling errors and production delays

### Solution Delivered
- **Desktop Application**: Built with Electron for cross-platform compatibility
- **Python Backend**: Robust PDF generation and data processing engine
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive GUI for non-technical staff
- **Automated Workflow**: Eliminated manual design work entirely  
- **Production Integration**: Seamless fit into existing manufacturing processes
- **Training & Documentation**: Comprehensive user guides and staff training
- **Ongoing Support**: Post-deployment maintenance and feature updates

### Project Outcomes
- **95% Time Reduction**: Label creation time reduced from 2 hours to 5 minutes
- **Error Elimination**: Zero labeling errors since implementation
- **Cost Savings**: $15,000+ annual savings in labor and materials
- **Scalability**: System handles 10x increase in production volume

## Use Cases

- **Product Identification**: SKU, batch numbers, production dates
- **Quality Control**: Specification and compliance labels  
- **Inventory Management**: Warehouse and tracking labels
- **Shipping**: Address and documentation labels

## Configuration

Labels are generated based on criteria such as:

```python
label_criteria = {
    "product_type": "electronics",
    "batch_size": 1000,
    "production_date": "2024-08-19",
    "quality_grade": "A"
}
```
